# YOUR PROJECT TITLE: Soil Mechanics (simple)
#### Video Demo:  (https://youtu.be/eZ1-ygLEOYc)
#### Description: As a civil engineering student, I am required to determine certain properties of soil. As I am lazy to draw circles by hand, I have come up with equations and codes to plot the circle and determine if the soil is stable or not. This code also performs simple calculation such as the permeability of soil.
