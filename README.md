# YOUR PROJECT TITLE: Soil Mechanics (simple)
#### Video Demo:  (https://youtu.be/eZ1-ygLEOYc)
#### Description: As a civil engineering student, I am required to determine certain properties of soil. As I am lazy to draw circles by hand, I have come up with equations and codes to plot the circle and determine if the soil is stable or not. This code also performs simple calculation such as the permeability of soil.

Initially I tried to plot the equations and use matplotlib to find the intersection points. However, this was too difficult for me and hence I decided to do it the mathematical way by finding the perpendicular distance from the line to the centre of the circle.

I did consider using dictionaries and while loop but was unable to proerly implement it and decided that if else was the best way to sort out the different scernarios available.
